Hello there!
♦️ I study computer science at the faculty of Mathematics, Informatics and Mechanics at the University of Warsaw;

♦️ I enjoy coding in JavaScript, C++ and Java;

♦️ I'm interested in gamedev, cryptology and web aplications;

♦️ I would love to learn something new about Flutter;


If I learned one thing during my studies, it would be this:
"A QA engineer walks into a bar. Orders a beer. Orders 0 beers. Orders 99999999999 beers. Orders a lizard. Orders -1 beers. Orders fwefwepfmw.
First real customer walks in and asks where the bathroom is. The bar bursts into flames."
